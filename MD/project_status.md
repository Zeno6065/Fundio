# Fundio Project Status

## Completed Tasks

1. **Theme Toggle Button Implementation**
   - Created `ThemeToggleButton` widget in `lib/widgets/theme_toggle_button.dart`
   - Added theme toggle functionality to the following screens:
     - Home Screen (`lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart`)
     - Account Details Screen (`lib/screens/account/account_details_screen.dart`)
     - Create Account Screen (`lib/screens/account/create_account_screen.dart`)
     - Create Deposit Screen (`lib/screens/account/create_deposit_screen.dart`)
     - Create Withdrawal Screen (`lib/screens/account/create_withdrawal_screen.dart`)
     - Edit Profile Screen (`lib/screens/profile/edit_profile_screen.dart`)
     - Login Screen (`lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart`) - Added to top right corner as screen lacks AppBar
     - Register Screen (`lib/screens/auth/register_screen.dart`)
     - Forgot Password Screen (`lib/screens/auth/forgot_password_screen.dart`)
     - Join Account Screen (`lib/screens/account/join_account_screen.dart`)

2. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed `CardTheme` to `CardThemeData` in `lib/constants/app_theme.dart` to match Flutter 3.8+ API

## Issues Identified

1. **Package Dependencies**
   - Missing `flutter_local_notifications` package causing build errors
   - App uses Flutter SDK version ^3.8.1 which requires updated theme components

## Pending Tasks

1. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Run `flutter pub add flutter_local_notifications` to add the missing package
   - Ensure all dependencies are compatible with Flutter 3.8+

2. **Testing**
   - Test theme toggle functionality across all screens
   - Verify dark/light theme appearance and consistency
   - Test theme persistence using SharedPreferences

3. **Potential Optimizations**
   - Consider refactoring AppBar implementations to reduce code duplication
   - Review theme definitions for any other outdated API usage

## Completion Level

- **Theme Toggle Implementation**: 100% complete
- **Bug Fixes**: 50% complete (CardTheme fixed, but app still has build errors)
- **Overall Project Status**: 75% complete
